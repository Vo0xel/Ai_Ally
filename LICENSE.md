Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The Ai Ally General Public License (AAGPL) is a free, copyleft license for software and other works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network-based applications and services.

Most software licenses are designed to restrict your freedom to share, modify, and use the software. In contrast, our Ai Ally General Public Licenses are intended to protect your freedom to share and change all versions of the software, ensuring that it remains free for everyone to use, modify, and distribute.

When we speak of "free software," we are referring to freedom, not price. The purpose of our licenses is to guarantee that you have the freedom to:

Share copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish),
Receive the source code, or get it if you need it,
Modify the software, or use pieces of it in new free programs,
Know that these rights are protected for you.
To safeguard your rights, developers using the Ai Ally General Public License take two steps:

They assert copyright on their software.
They offer you this License, which legally permits you to copy, distribute, and/or modify the software.
A key benefit of this system is that any improvements made in one version of the program, if widely used, become available for other developers to incorporate. This encourages collaboration and innovation in the free software ecosystem.

However, for software used in networked services, simply making modified versions available on servers doesn't ensure the software remains free. With the Ai Ally General Public License, this is different:
It ensures that any modified version running on a publicly accessible server provides the public access to the source code of that modified version.

In essence, if a modified version is used on a server where the public can access it, the operator must make the source code of that modified version available to the users of the server. Thus, the public use of software on a server triggers the obligation to share the source code.
